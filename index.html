    <p>Hello teacher! My name is Thanh Thủy, and I was born on January 14, 2004, making me 20 years old. I was born and raised in Hanoi, where I currently live with my parents in a cozy home about 20 kilometers from my school. I’m a second-year student of K64 in the Information Technology department. My passion lies in computers and logical thinking, and I truly enjoy the challenges and rewards that come with working in the field of technology.

        In my free time, I love engaging in activities that allow me to apply logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. These interests have driven me to work hard in my studies, and my dedication has paid off with a scholarship in my first semester. Looking ahead, I plan to continue striving for academic excellence, particularly in this English course, as I know it will be crucial for achieving scholarships in future semesters. My ultimate goal is to build a strong foundation for a successful career in the IT industry.
        
        Thank you very much for listening to my introduction.
        </p>
